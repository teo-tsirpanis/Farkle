# Farkle 7's builder API

Developed in the summer of 2019 and introduced in version 5.1.0, Farkle's builder is the newest of the three major library components (the other being the grammars and the parser). Its design is mostly good, and its general principles will be carried over to Farkle 7. However, there are some things that can be improved. Instead of exhaustively outlining the entire builder API, this document will only cover the changes planned or considered for Farkle 7.

## Separate global and local options

## Remove the generic option setter methods

## Reconsider case-insensitivity by default

## Regularize the string regex language

## Compatibility levels

## P&A for nonterminals

## Uniform F# operators
