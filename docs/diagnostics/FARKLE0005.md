# FARKLE0005: Nonterminal was not set productions

This warning is emitted when a recursive nonterminal was created, but its productions were never set with the `SetProductions` method. This method allows nonterminals to be defined with productions that contain the nonterminals themselves, and not calling it will result in a nonterminal that can never be produced, which will result in a grammar that might subsequently fail to parse.

To fix this warning, make sure you have called `SetProductions` on the nonterminal before building a grammar that contains it.

## Example code

```csharp
// Non-compliant code
Nonterminal<int> myNonterminal = Nonterminal.Create<int>("MyNonterminal");

// Compliant code
Nonterminal<int> myNonterminal = Nonterminal.Create<int>("MyNonterminal");
myNonterminal.SetProductions(
    // â€¦
);
```
